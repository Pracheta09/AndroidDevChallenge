## Tell us what your idea is
As rightly said by Einstein,  

        “Information is not knowledge” 
        
And when it comes to knowing about anything, the first thing that comes to a user’s mind is,

          “Let me Google it” 
        
Depending upon the complexity of the topic, the user might spend few minutes to several months getting to understand and get a hold of the topic. Considering complex “How to ” do something, the idea is to 

    automate the process of digging into several articles and videos for understanding and 
    coming up with next steps by using NLP and deep learning 
    to predict the next steps to take and 
    connect with resources online/ near me stores according to user needs/inputs 
    to get the thing done as quickly as possible. 
    
Example: Suppose, I want to purchase an inverter for my home, when I type “How to purchase inverter for home ” we can get the result as shown in the picture.  
- You can think of it as a chatbot for that particular “how - to” 
- Neural net that can predict next steps for you for that particular task 
Other areas: In WikiHow – we have wide range of how-to according to categories which can be utilized. 
Using Federated learning individual learnings for complex topics can be fed back to central model. This allows for smarter models, lower latency, and less power consumption, all while ensuring privacy.

## Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life.   
For this to be completed and integrated, I would require Google’s help in: 
- Development of Deep learning models 
- Architecture of Federated learning to deployment 
- Integration with Search  
Above is still in Ideation phase I’m learning more about the technicalities & the idea itself But I’m sure with your guidance, my dedication to deliver and state of the art NLP models like BERT we can surely see it live by May 2020  

## Tell us about you.    
“In permanent beta” is how I would introduce myself. 
I’m currently working in UBS as Software Engineer and have graduated recently in 2018 as a CS grad from Pune University (VIT, Pune)

Interest in exploring what excites me most in college led me to doing projects in Android and NLP. Last year itself, for UBS an android app was developed & deployed within two month for Digital Summit of UBS.  
I have also completed internship in a startup by collaborating in the software development lifecycle of chatbots that can cater to user queries and support questions for clients which gave me a good hands-on with NLP and ML. 
Last month itself, I and my team have delivered Tech talk at the Digital Garage, UBS by creating well commented Jupyter notebooks around understanding building blocks of Neural Networks, Different architectures, Transfer Learning and NLP that has resulted into a community of 60+ AI enthusiasts. 
Passion for impact, learning and previous hands on with Android and ML is what makes me think I can collaborate with Google experts and deliver this idea  
PFA my resume & Github projects for more details.
